 *  2) Queuing delay
 *  3) Transmission delay
 *  4) Propagation delay
 *  
 * Total nodal delay = Nodal processing delay + Queuing delay + Transmission delay + Propagation delay
 * 
 * 1) Nodal processing delay
 * 	Calculate time of the packet trans where, in the route port.
 * 
 * 2) Queing delay
