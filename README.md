## Introduce
This repository is consists of 1_basic network function's pseudo code, 2_network protocol's pseudo code, 3_jnetpcap tutorial code. There is not large program project, but pseudo code bundle for network study & programming and etc.   
## Range of dig
This repository is researching all of the network range. Following the International Organization for Standardization(ISO) Network Systems / Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model(OSI) 7 Layer.   
* _OSI 7 Layer Structure_

The network protocol's pseudo code part treats limited and integrated range. First, not treats Physical Layer because of the natural link area. And combines Session Layer, Presentation Layer, Application Layer. These layers are collectively classified as L5.   
* _Protocol Pseudo Code Range_

Last, This repository treats the Jnetpcap Library in Java, that is pcap library.
